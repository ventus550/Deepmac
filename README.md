## Deep Q-Learning Components
- Double Q-Network (optional but significant)
- Experience replay (learning in batches)
- Each batch contains replays (state, action, reward, new state) 

## TODO
1. Regular Q-learning model
2. Neural Network Architectures
3. Test various input formats
4. Genetic algo?
